# MarsRover

This is the MarsRover Technical Challenge for iTV. 

The MarsRover can freely move and rotate (clockwise or anti-clockwise) in a n X m grid. When the MarsRover is at the
edge of the grid, it can appear on the other side. 

## Test

`sbt test`

## Note

I only had time to do Part 1 of the challenge well. Would be willing to discuss Parts 2 and 3 in person.
